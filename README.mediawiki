Adds a ”print this image” link to the image page TOC, for local image files (in compatible browsers).

The extension is known to work in recent, and not so recent, versions of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Opera. Making it work in Chrome requires an ugly hack though, and there might be cases where it doesn't work.
